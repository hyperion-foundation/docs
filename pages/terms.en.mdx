## Introduction
Thanks for giving your time to read our terms. We know some of you are not ignoring these terms, but we want you know more about us and what you expect from us.

## Age Requirement
If you are still underage (under 15 years old) when you want to join our community or use our services, you should know if we don't accept people that are still underage.
We recommend you to do not join our community or even use our services if you are still underage. We don't have any responsibility if you still continue to join our community or use our services.
We never recommend you to continue to join our community or even use our services if you have permissions from your parents or guardians.

## Your Expectations
We are actively developing and improving our community to be a better and healthy community, that's why we avoid any NSFW contents in our community.
And we do not tolerate to any people who have sent any NSFW contents in our community, we will give them the right punishment by banning them **permanently**.
And you are welcome if you don't like our community, because most of people are not so happy and can't familiarize themself with our policies.

## Our Expectations
We want our members to know their own place, which means you should respect each other with other members even with the community staff. We always respect our members if they are good on behaving and civil to each other.

## Content Permissions/Restrictions
Since our primary communication platform is by using **Discord**, we don't accept any NSFW contents in our community. If you don't know what **NSFW** means, NSFW stands for **Not Safe for Work** and it defined like this : 

> Not safe for work is Internet slang or shorthand used to mark links to content, videos, or website pages the viewer may not wish to be seen looking at in a public, formal or controlled environment.
