## What is Custom Channel?
Custom Channel is a private-room alike, but it can be customized by yourself (room master/channel owner). Custom Channel only available on **Hyperion** Discord server (Main).

## Who are able to create a Custom Channel?
All Hyperion members who have joined the Hyperion Discord server and have reached the **Diamond** rank. And the offer to create a custom channel is FREE.

## I got the **Diamond** rank. So, can I have my own channel now?
If you have earned the **Diamond** rank and have been a member on the Hyperion Discord server for **1 month**/**more**, then you are allowed to have your own channel.
If you have earned the **Diamond** rank and have been a member on the Hyperion Discord server for less than **1 month**, then you are not allowed to create or have your own channel.

## I feel I have met all the requirements, how do I create my own channel?
You can do ping/mention the **Admin** or **Mod** who are currently online, and you don't need to spam ping/mention. And we will only help you with the channel creation, and regarding channel naming, bitrate quality setting, and data center locations are your own responsibility (as the channel owner).

## Do server rules apply to each custom channel?
Some of the rules still apply to all registered custom channels, therefore you must still follow the rules that have been set.

## I have another questions about custom channel!
