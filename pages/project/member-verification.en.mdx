## Project Information
Member Verification is a web project to verify accounts of Hyperion members on the Hyperion Discord server. This project is under development.

## Project Goal
We want to create this project only to verify all Hyperion members if their Discord account is a valid account not a [self-bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bot-vs-user-accounts) account.

## How to verify account
This project has not been completed, and there is no definite date that we will release this project.
