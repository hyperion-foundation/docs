## Project Information
Rin-chan is a private Discord music bot. Rin-chan was made and hosted exclusively for **Hyperion Foundation** Discord server.
Rin-chan music playlists are provided by [Lofi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl).

### Project/Bot Version
This type of project doesn't have any version, because there will be no changes to the project.

## Goal Project
Rin-chan was purposely made to provide a **Lofi** music playlist 24/7 or non-stop. All Hyperion Foundation members can listen to Rin-chan on **ðŸŽµ Lofi Lounge** (stage channel).

## How to Invite Rin-chan
Unfortunately, Rin-chan is not a public Discord bot like [Shaii Classic](/project/shaii-classic), so you can't invite Rin-chan to your server.

## How to use Rin-chan
Rin-chan doesn't have any public commands like [Shaii](/project/shaii) or [Shaii Classic](/project/shaii-classic), so you cannot interact with Rin-chan.
