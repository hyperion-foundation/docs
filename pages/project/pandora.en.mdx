## Project Information
Pandora is a private Discord bot for securing our Discord servers from malicious activity.

### Project/Bot Version
`v0.5.0`

## Goal Project
Pandora was purposely made to secure our Discord servers. Pandora can scan and delete any bad words, etc.

## How to Invite Pandora
Pandora is not a public Discord bot like [Shaii Classic](/project/shaii-classic). You can't invite Pandora to your server.
We will try to consider creating another version of Pandora that can be used for the public.

## Self Host
If you are interested, you can host Pandora by yourself. Visit the [Pandora repository](https://github.com/hyperion-foundation/pandora) to clone (download) the source code.

But be aware, The current Pandora source code is not very stable (dev), that because we are still developing it (minimal features). If you still insist to host it by yourself, please use the source code at your own risk.

We do NOT provide any support if you have any problems on your end.

## How to use Pandora
All Hyperion Foundation members only can issue Pandora basic commands such as see project/bot version, etc. 
Administrative commands (e.g. ban member, kick member, etc) cannot be issued if the member doesn't have the required roles and permissions.
