## Command Information
Each Shaii command has several information. These information should be sufficient enough for you to learn the command. On this section, we put detailed and simplest command information.

- **Command Description**
  - This information displays the detailed and simplest command description.
- **Aliases**
  - This information displays the command aliases. Command aliases are only available for **Legacy Command** command type.
- **Command Availability**
  - This information displays the availability of the command.
      - If the availability is **Yes**, which means the command is available for **Legacy Command** & **Slash Command**.
      - ~~If the availability is **Yes (Partial)**, which means the command is partially available. It can be available for **Legacy Command** or **Slash Command** only.~~ \*
      - If the availability is **No**, which means the command is not available or cannot be used. It can be under development, bugs, etc.
- **Command Type**
  - ~~This information displays the type of the command. It can be only **Legacy Command** or **Slash Command**. **Command Type** is dependant on **Command Availability**.~~ \*
- **Voice Channel Requirement**
  - This information displays if this command requires user voice channel connection.
    - If the requirement is **Required**, the user must be in a voice channel at first before executing the command.
    - If the requirement is **Not Required**, the user do not have to enter any voice channel for executing the command.
- **Example Usage**
  - This information displays how to use the command.
    - ~~For **Legacy Command**, the command prefix starts with the bot prefix (`s!`).~~ \*
    - For **Slash Command**, the command prefix starts with the `/` (slash). 
    `/` (slash) prefix is the default prefix for this command type, because the prefix is the native prefix for [Discord Application Commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands).
