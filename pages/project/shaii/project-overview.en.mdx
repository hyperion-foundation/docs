## Project Description
Shaii is a different edition of [Shaii Classic](/project/shaii-classic). Shaii is made for **Hyperion Foundation** Discord server only (non-public Discord bot).

#### Project/Bot Version
`v2.3.2`

## Project Goal
Shaii purposely made for **Hyperion Foundation** Discord server only, that's it. Shaii is no different with [Shaii Classic](/project/shaii-classic), it's just a different project name.

## How to Invite Shaii
Shaii is not a public Discord bot like [Shaii Classic](/project/shaii-classic), so you can't have Shaii on your server.

## How to Use Shaii
Type `/help` in **#bot-commands** (**Hyperion Foundation** Discord server) to see the list of Shaii commands.

**Slash Command** feature is now the default interaction system. We have disabled **legacy command** feature permanently. (This feature was disabled on **December 10th, 2023**)
