## Project Information
Shaii is a different edition of Shaii Classic. Shaii is made for Hyperion Foundation Discord server only (non-public Discord bot).

### Project/Bot Version
`v1.5.0`

## Project Goal
Shaii purposely made for Hyperion Foundation Discord server only, that's it. Shaii is no different with Shaii Classic, it's just a different project name.

## How to Invite Shaii
Shaii is not a public Discord bot like **Shaii Classic**, so you can't have Shaii on your server.

## How to Use Shaii
Type `s!help` or `s!commands` in **#bot-commands** (Hyperion Discord server) to see the list of Shaii commands.

**Slash Command** feature is now available on Shaii even though not all commands are fully perfect because it's still being developed. Type `/help` in **#bot-commands** (Hyperion Foundation Discord server) to see the list of Shaii commands.

      - If the availability is **No**, which means the command is not available or cannot be used. It can be under development, bugs, etc.
