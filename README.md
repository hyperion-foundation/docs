# Hyperion Website
Official website build for Hyperion Foundation (stable).

## What we use / Tech stack
The current website is built using **Next.js**.

## Contributing
We always welcome to everyone who wants to contribute our project. Keep in mind, if you want to contribute in this project, please join this [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6dSRjs) server first, then give us a ping in **#general** channel and also tell us what will you do before we accept you to be our contributor of the project. We want the landing site made as simple as possible. If you have any design mock-ups, don't hesitate to send it to us, we'd like to see any creativity you have but don't be sad if your design got rejected by us.

## Help
As we said before, you should join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6dSRjs) server and then you can communicate with us if you need help with the current project. For any issue related to the project, you can create [an new issue](https://github.com/hyperion-foundation/landing/issues) but before you create an issue, please **make sure you search first** to ensure your current issue is already created by others or not.
> Disclaimer : We don't use any other communication platform except Discord.
