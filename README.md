# Hyperion Website
The **dev** builds (unstable version) for Hyperion Foundation website.

## What we use / Tech stack
In this branch ([dev](https://github.com/hyperion-foundation/landing/tree/dev)), we build the website using **Next.js** and this branch was created for a testing/development purposes, so bugs will be more expected to appear and all codes in this branch **100%** cannot be used for production release. We will push to **master** branch if necessary and **master** branch meant to be the production (stable version) release of the website.

## Contributing
We always welcome to everyone who wants to contribute our project. Keep in mind, if you want to contribute in this project, please join this [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6dSRjs) server first, then give us a ping in **#general** channel and also tell us what will you do before we accept you to be our contributor of the project. We want the landing site made as simple as possible. If you have any design mock-ups, don't hesitate to send it to us, we'd like to see any creativity you have but don't be sad if your design got rejected by us.

For any issue related to the project, you can create [an new issue](https://github.com/hyperion-foundation/landing/issues) but before you create an issue, please **make sure you search first** to ensure your current issue is already created by others or not.
