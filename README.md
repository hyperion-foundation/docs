# Hyperion Website
The **dev** builds for Hyperion Foundation website.

## What we use / Tech stack
In this branch ([dev](https://github.com/hyperion-foundation/landing/tree/dev)), we build the website using **Next.js** and this branch was created for a development purposes, so bugs will be more expected to appear and all codes in this branch 100% cannot be used for live version. We will push to **master** branch if necessary and **master** branch meant to be a stable version of the landing website.

## Bug List
These are the listed bugs of this project and these bugs will be fixed soon as possible :
- There are several pages without any contents, and we will add the proper content on each pages.
- The text logo shown perfectly on **Firefox**, but on **Microsoft Edge**, the text logo seems not shown perfectly, and we don't test it on **Google Chrome** yet. We assume if we test it on **Google Chrome**, it might shown the same as like on **Microsoft Edge**.
